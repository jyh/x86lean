"""PR titles and bodies are not git objects. Nothing scanned them.

WHY THIS EXISTS (desk row I(a), commissioned from a sibling seat's audit)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
The firewall gate beside this file scans commit messages, added lines, the
whole tree, and all of message history — four arms over GIT OBJECTS. A pull
request's TITLE and BODY are none of those: they live only in the forge's
database, they are the prose a reader actually sees first on the public repo
page, and they are EDITABLE FOREVER. The most-read public prose surface was
the one surface no arm covered. Measured before this shipped: one PR body in
this fleet carried a private-record path for five days (found 08/30) while
every git-object arm stayed green, because no git object ever contained it.

THE FOURTH DOOR (same audit, item (f)): a push to the BASE branch fires no
run for the PRs that target it, so a PR can sit green and MERGEABLE while
every one of its verdicts is about a base that no longer exists. Status is a
claim about a PAIR of refs at a moment; the pair moves and the status does
not. So this arm never reads status alone — it re-reads the REFS on every
run and says which object each verdict is actually about (REF-vs-RUN).

WHY IT RUNS FROM THE PUSH WORKFLOW AND NOT A pull_request TRIGGER: the
pull_request event fires on the PR's OWN pushes; it does not fire when the
base moves, and it does not fire when someone EDITS a description after the
checks are green. A push-triggered sweep of ALL open PRs re-reads everything
the forge currently says, every time anything lands — the only cadence that
closes both doors. (The event payload is deliberately never read: a
schedule-triggered run has none, and a guard scoped wider than its event set
fails open — measured in this fleet, 08/30.)

THE SESSION ARM (desk MC, 2026-09-14): a chat-session URL reached a public
PR body and every arm here was green, because this gate read private-record
PATHS and nothing else. The harness that opens PRs instructs every description
to END with its session URL, so every seat that opens a PR meets this. The
commit-trailer gate already owned the session shapes for commit messages; the
same list now reads PR titles and bodies, and a finding names the PR and the
surface but NEVER echoes the matched text, because a CI log on a public repo is
public too.

SHAPES: imported from the sibling gate, never re-typed. A fixture is a
snapshot of a vocabulary; a copied pattern list is a stale fixture the day
the sibling moves. One list, one owner, two readers.
