"""PR titles and bodies are not git objects. Nothing scanned them.

WHY THIS EXISTS (desk row I(a), commissioned from a sibling seat's audit)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
The firewall gate beside this file scans commit messages, added lines, the
whole tree, and all of message history — four arms over GIT OBJECTS. A pull
request's TITLE and BODY are none of those: they live only in the forge's
database, they are the prose a reader actually sees first on the public repo
page, and they are EDITABLE FOREVER. The most-read public prose surface was
the one surface no arm covered. Measured before this shipped: one PR body in
this fleet carried a private-record path for five days (found 08/30) while
every git-object arm stayed green, because no git object ever contained it.

THE FOURTH DOOR (same audit, item (f)): a push to the BASE branch fires no
run for the PRs that target it, so a PR can sit green and MERGEABLE while
every one of its verdicts is about a base that no longer exists. Status is a
claim about a PAIR of refs at a moment; the pair moves and the status does
not. So this arm never reads status alone — it re-reads the REFS on every
run and says which object each verdict is actually about (REF-vs-RUN).

WHY IT RUNS FROM THE PUSH WORKFLOW AND NOT A pull_request TRIGGER: the
pull_request event fires on the PR's OWN pushes; it does not fire when the
base moves, and it does not fire when someone EDITS a description after the
checks are green. A push-triggered sweep of ALL open PRs re-reads everything
the forge currently says, every time anything lands — the only cadence that
closes both doors. (The event payload is deliberately never read: a
schedule-triggered run has none, and a guard scoped wider than its event set
fails open — measured in this fleet, 08/30.)

THE SESSION ARM (desk MC, 2026-09-14): a chat-session URL reached a public
PR body and every arm here was green, because this gate read private-record
PATHS and nothing else. The harness that opens PRs instructs every description
to END with its session URL, so every seat that opens a PR meets this. The
commit-trailer gate already owned the session shapes for commit messages; the
same list now reads PR titles and bodies, and a finding names the PR and the
surface but NEVER echoes the matched text, because a CI log on a public repo is
public too.

THE EDITED DOOR (desks SN and WB, 2026-09-21): this check became a REQUIRED
status check on the default branch, so a red one now BLOCKS the merge. The
remedy for forge-side prose is an EDIT on the forge, and an edit is not a
push: `pull_request` defaults to opened/synchronize/reopened, so the fix that
cleared the finding fired no run and its author sat blocked after doing
exactly what this gate told them to. The workflow now lists `edited`, and the
remedy printed below is DERIVED FROM THE WORKFLOW'S BYTES (edited_trigger_armed)
rather than asserted -- it promises a re-run only where the trigger says so,
and the self-test reds if this repository's trigger drops it.

SHAPES: imported from the sibling gate, never re-typed. A fixture is a
snapshot of a vocabulary; a copied pattern list is a stale fixture the day
the sibling moves. One list, one owner, two readers.

THE SUBJECT ARM (desk QA, 2026-09-16): the owner ruled eleven public commit
SUBJECTS -- nine carrying an employer-lane or private project name, two
carrying a family reference -- ACCEPTED AS DECLARED DEBT rather than
rewritten, and commissioned a gate so that no NEW subject or PR title carries
either class. Every one of the nine was written by a commit that was adding
that very name to the sibling gate, whose source is assembled from parts so it
never spells it: the artifact was hardened and the metadata that delivered it
was not. None of the three scrub gates read a subject for a bare word.
  * LANE NAMES are the sibling's own lists, IMPORTED (its ROOTS_DIGEST is
    printed on every PASS line, so each repo's CI log shows which list it
    ran), minus the one personal-lane campaign the ruling scoped out. They
    are refused in commit subjects, PR titles, PR head refs (a merge subject
    quotes the ref), PR bodies, and -- FORWARD ONLY -- commit bodies. The
    commit bodies already public are history this gate does not touch, and
    FORWARD-ONLY IS A PROPERTY OF THE RANGE THE CALLER PASSES: a range that
    lists an already-public commit whose body carries a word reds on it (the
    baseline accepts subjects, never bodies), so a caller passes only the
    commits a push adds. --history reads subjects alone for the same reason.
  * FAMILY REFERENCES are refused in subjects, titles and refs only: a body
    uses these words as code identifiers (a `kids(_:_:)` function) and
    `family` is a technical word here (76 public subjects use it that way).
  * NOT COVERED, by construction: third-party personal names. A word list
    cannot tell a citation of published work from social context, and the
    same people appear in both, so it would refuse a citation. Every PASS
    line says so.
A finding names the commit or PR, the surface and the CLASS -- never the word.
(Measured 2026-09-16 over 10,613 default-branch commits in six public repos:
76 subjects use `family` technically, and the nine lane subjects found by word
pieces agree with an independent census that used literal needles.)
