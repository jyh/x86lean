"""Council 5b ruled the firewall line at PATHS. Nothing enforced it.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
On 2026-08-25 at 10:49:22 the council ruled, in the Captain's words as minuted:
**paths into the private record are forbidden on public repos; bare filenames
are softened opportunistically; role-wording is the standard.** The minute also
recorded that the CI gate for it was "booked construction" — booked, not built.

Booked is not built, and the gap was measured rather than assumed. Of the 9
commits that landed on this repository at or after that stamp, **3 carried a
path-shaped string** — one of them 1 minute 41 seconds after the ruling, and one
of them written by the seat that then built this gate. Nothing anywhere tested
for it: the sibling gate in this directory scans commit messages and file
contents for a session trailer and a chat URL, and for nothing else.

That 3-of-9 rate is the justification. A rule obeyed by remembering is obeyed
for exactly as long as it is remembered, and the first lapse arrived inside two
minutes.

⭐ **AND THE FIRST CENSUS OF THAT RATE WAS RIGHT BY ARITHMETIC AND WRONG BY
MEMBERSHIP -- WHICH IS WORSE THAN BEING WRONG.** The hand census that justified
this gate scanned COMMIT MESSAGES ONLY and named three commits. This gate, run
over the same window with both arms and the ruled definition, also finds three
-- but not the same three. One named commit drops out (its absolute path points
into a PUBLIC tool, and the ruling forbade paths into the PRIVATE record, not
absolute paths generally). One unnamed commit enters, seven minutes after the
ruling, because it added a private path into a tracked FILE, which a
message-only census is structurally blind to.

TWO INDEPENDENT ERRORS CANCELLED INTO A MATCHING COUNT. Had the totals been
compared without the membership, the agreement would have read as
corroboration of a set that was one-third wrong. A count is not a scope, and
two counts agreeing is not two measurements agreeing.

WHAT COUNTS AS THE PRIVATE RECORD
---------------------------------
Not a guess — the fleet map is the authority, and these are the roots it names
as never-public: the seat repo (PRIVATE FOREVER), the employer-lane repos, the
the private project repos (FOUR since row IB), the per-seat runtime config directories, the kit run
surface, and the fleet bus. They are assembled from parts below so that this
file's own source does not match its own patterns. That is not cleverness; a
detector whose documentation trips it is a shape this fleet has hit repeatedly,
and the sibling gate carries the same defence for the same reason.

**AND THIS FILE TRIPPED ITSELF ON ITS FIRST RUN, THREE TIMES.** The patterns
were assembled from parts, correctly -- but the PROSE explaining them spelled
two forbidden shapes out verbatim, as examples of what is forbidden. The
explanation of a rule is a carrier of the rule. Nothing here spells a forbidden
shape literally now; every example is assembled or described in words.

WHAT IS DELIBERATELY *NOT* FORBIDDEN
------------------------------------
* **A bare filename.** The ruling softens these explicitly. The bus file's bare
  name passes; the same name suffixed with a colon and a line number does not,
  because a line-anchored citation is a pointer INTO the private record's
  contents rather than a mention of its name. (Neither form is spelled out
  anywhere in this file, deliberately -- see the note on carriers below.) That
  reading is a judgement this gate makes visible rather than hides: it is a
  separate shape with its own label, so it can be struck on its own.
* **Role-wording**, which the ruling names as the standard: "the helm's brief",
  "another seat's bank", "the private record". This gate must never make the
  compliant form harder than the forbidden one.
* **Absolute paths into PUBLIC repos.** `/Users/x/projects/claude/saltworks/...`
  reveals machine layout, but the ruling forbade paths into the PRIVATE RECORD
  and said nothing about this. Measured here at the time of writing: 33 tracked
  files and 78 occurrences carry that shape. Sweeping them in would be quietly
  extending an instrument past its ruling — the exact move the same council's
  law harvest condemned ("declare an instrument's blind spot, never quietly
  extend it"). DECLARED, therefore, and left alone.

* **Wiki-style card links.** The fleet's memory cards point at one another with
  a card slug wrapped in doubled square brackets. That notation names a card in
  the private record without spelling a path, so the path patterns cannot see it
  and neither could a message-only census. The class is ruled KEEP (council
  2026-09-06), so this is a declaration and not a deferral.

      ref                            occurrences  files  distinct
      saltworks  master   d92a48a        159        60      56
      salt       main     c36096fc         2         1       2
      jas        main     6fc16192         1         1       1

  Snapshots taken 2026-09-06, not properties, and each row names its ref for the
  reason the frame block below gives: a repo does not have a count, a ref does.
  ⛔ AND THE DISCRIMINATOR, IF ONE IS EVER BUILT, MUST KEY ON THE NOTATION AND
  NEVER ON WHETHER THE LINK RESOLVES. The mirror lags the live banks and a
  renamed card stops resolving, so non-resolution is not evidence of
  non-pointer: a gate testing "does this link resolve?" goes quiet in the
  DANGEROUS direction. That is a seat's finding, not this file's, and it is
  recorded here because the next author of this section will reach for the
  resolve test first.
  ⛔ AND THE COUNTING RULE, LEARNED BY GETTING IT WRONG WHILE WRITING THIS
  PARAGRAPH. The same notation spells array-of-array types, build-manifest table
  headers and proof-assistant literals in ordinary code, so a bare count of the
  bracket shape is not a count of this class: it reads 36 in salt and 655 in jas,
  where the true figures are 2 and 1. The criterion is a HYPHENATED lower-case
  slug. Controlled against a relaxed criterion that also admits single-word
  names, the extra hits are manifest table headers and one literal -- no card
  links -- so the strict rule loses nothing at these refs. A NUMBER HERE MUST
  NAME THE OBJECT IT WAS MEASURED ON; the first draft of this bullet carried
  three figures that matched no ref of any of these repos.
  DECLARED, therefore, and left alone.

THE FRAME THIS INSTRUMENT MEASURES (it travels; it must say)
------------------------------------------------------------
This file is byte-identical in every PUBLIC repo of this fleet that carries the
firewall: salt, saltworks, jas and tt-neural-dataflow-fabric as of 2026-09-08.

⛔ THAT LIST IS A SNAPSHOT, AND ITS PREVIOUS VERSION WAS WRONG FOR TWO WEEKS IN
THE ONE DIRECTION A READER CANNOT SEE. It read "salt, saltworks and jas", and
every word of it was TRUE of the copies that existed -- while a FOURTH public
repo carried none of the layers and therefore held no copy of this sentence to
be wrong in. An enumeration of installs, written inside the thing installed,
CANNOT NAME THE PLACE IT IS ABSENT. It reads as a population and is only ever a
census of the already-compliant.
  ⇒ 🔑 SO DO NOT AUDIT COVERAGE FROM THIS LINE. The population is what the
    forge answers for public visibility (`gh repo list --visibility public`);
    this line is a claim about BYTE-IDENTITY among the copies, nothing more.
    Ported to the fourth repo 2026-09-08 by evidence (saltworks lead), desk row
    HU, after silicon and the helm measured the gap the sentence could not.

Every number below was measured by this gate, and each row NAMES ITS REF.

⛔ THE FIRST VERSION OF THIS BLOCK SAID "salt · 2142 commits · 0 findings" AND
THAT WAS MEASURED ON THE DEFAULT BRANCH ALONE. A long-lived branch of the same
repo carried ELEVEN. I NAMED A REPO WHERE I HAD MEASURED A REF -- not false,
but under-scoped, which is worse: it reads as a repo-level clean bill, and it
was quoted as a frame disclosure for four hours. A REPO DOES NOT HAVE A FINDING
COUNT; A REF DOES.

    ref                        commits  tracked  message-arm findings
    saltworks  master             2138      850  14
    salt       main               2145     1426   0
    salt       math/w1-e3-port    2579     1463   0   <- was 11; a Captain-ruled
                                                         purge cleared them
    jas        main               3192     2115   5   <- genuine, all one shape,
                                                         all predating the ruling
    tt-ndf     main  0e71905        15       32   0   <- measured at the ref the
                                                         port landed on, 09-08

These are SNAPSHOTS taken 2026-08-25, not properties. A branch that forked
before this gate landed has never been scanned end to end; if you own a
long-lived branch, one full-range run is cheap and yours to own.

No repo contains a directory whose top-level name collides with a private-record
root, checked in all three before this shipped -- a repo that did would red on
every ordinary reference to its own tree.

WHY THE SCAN IS A DELTA, NOT ALL OF HISTORY
-------------------------------------------
Measured before this gate was written, over 2127 commits and 847 tracked files:
history already carries ~15 commits and ~50 files with these shapes, all of them
predating the ruling and protected by the commencement clause (no ex post
facto). A full-history scan would therefore be permanently red, which is the
red-sweep-gets-abandoned failure the sibling workflow's own header documents and
solves the same way. The enforceable content of the ruling is **"no NEW path
into the private record enters a public repo"**, so that is what this scans:
the pushed delta's commit messages, and the delta's added/modified file lines.

# The first draft also excluded `/` and `.`, to stop a root name appearing mid
# path. It did stop that -- and it stopped the ABSOLUTE form too, because an
# absolute path into the private record has a `/` immediately before the root.
# That is the single case this gate most exists for, and the first draft was
# structurally blind to it. Caught by the self-test's real-instance fixture,

# instead: a public clone path has another letter after the root, never a
# separator, so it cannot match.
# ⛔ SEPARATOR CLASS, NOT A LITERAL SLASH -- ADDED AFTER A MEASUREMENT, 08/25.
# The first shipped version required a forward slash. Driven against six path
# shapes, FOUR WERE BLIND: a backslash-separated path, a half-normalised mixed
# path, a UNC double-backslash form, and a drive-letter absolute path. This
# fleet has a Windows seat, so those are authored shapes, not exotica.
#
# ⚠️ AND THE FIX IS IN THE PATTERN, NOT IN THE CI MATRIX. Wiring this gate onto
# a Windows runner does NOT make it see a backslash: both arms read git OBJECT
# bytes (measured -- no CR in either arm's output, and diff path headers are
# forward-slash on every platform), so the same regex over the same objects
# returns the same verdict wherever it executes. A lane changes WHERE a gate
# runs; only the pattern changes WHAT it can match.

# THE PRESERVED-RECORD EXEMPTION — Captain's ruling, 2026-08-25 21:1x.
#
# Five sites on one long-lived branch cite the private record and are PRESERVED
# BY RULING: they are records of observations, and a record of an observation
# must not change. The purge that cleared that branch's commit messages was
# message-only and correctly did not touch them.
#
# ⛔ WHAT WAS GRANTED IS NOT A MUTE. The ruling's words: green while each is
# preserved EXACTLY, RED THE MOMENT ONE DRIFTS -- "an exemption that just mutes
# them is not what was granted". So each site is pinned by the SHA-256 of its
# exact line, and drift-sensitivity falls out in both directions:
#
#   line EDITED   -> the new text hashes differently -> matches no pin
#                    -> it is an ORDINARY FINDING and the gate REDS. Automatic.
#   line GONE     -> the pin stops resolving at its ref -> the PIN AUDIT REDS.
#                    A delta scan alone is blind to this; that is why the audit
#                    exists as a second arm rather than a nicety.
#
# ⚠️ SCOPED BY REPO **AND** REF, and that is not caution -- it is measured. This
# file ships byte-identical to three public repos, and `docs/QUEUE.md` EXISTS IN
# TWO OF THEM AS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FILES. A path-scoped exemption would mute
# a finding in the wrong repository, which is the adjacent-object trap wearing a

# WHY NOT A WHOLE-TREE GATE. The tree carried 67 findings in 27 files on the
# day this was written, most of them line-anchored bus citations in 08/13-08/16
# ledgers that are RECORDS and were never in the ruling's scope to rewrite. A
# gate that reds on all of them would be routed around inside a day.
#
# SO: A RATCHET. `private_paths_baseline.tsv` lists the ACCEPTED residue as
# (file, line-sha16). `--tree` scans every tracked text file and REDS on any
# finding NOT in the baseline -- new residue, or residue that moved (a moved
# line hashes the same but its file changed; an edited line hashes anew).
# Baseline entries no longer present are reported as debt paid, never as a
# failure. The baseline shrinks by `--write-baseline` after a real repair; it
# grows only by the same explicit act, which is a reviewed diff, not a silent
# pass. The gate's own source is excluded (it assembles the shapes from parts
# and is self-tested for that separately).

# THE MESSAGE RATCHET — added 2026-08-30 by the helm on the council's row u.
#
# WHY A THIRD ARM. The delta gate charges the PUSH that carries a violating
# message; it cannot charge history for KEEPING one. Measured on the flagship
# repo: a merge push landed four branch commits whose messages cite the
# private record, the delta gate fired ON THAT RUN — and every later push was
# green, because the four had fallen into the next scan's BASE. Same
# laundering the tree ratchet closed for FILES, in the arm that had no
# ratchet. And a message is WORSE than a file here: a tracked file can be
# repaired, a pushed message cannot be edited without a force-push, which the
# council ruled out (08/30: ACCEPT + record, NO history rewrite).
#
# SO: A RATCHET, keyed on the one immutable identity a message has — its
# commit sha. `private_paths_message_baseline.tsv` lists the ACCEPTED
# historical commits. `--messages` scans EVERY message reachable from HEAD and
# REDS on any violating commit NOT in the baseline. Baseline entries absent
# from the scanned history are reported, never failed: a branch rooted before
# them legitimately lacks them, and after a rewrite membership—not
# existence—is the only claim the sha can carry.
#
# ⛔ THE BASELINE STORES sha + shape ONLY, NEVER THE OFFENDING LINE: a quoted
# excerpt would put the private path INTO the tree, where the tree ratchet
# (correctly) reds on it. The explanation of a rule is a carrier of the rule.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# THE HISTORY RATCHET — added 2026-09-09 by paris, on the PUB-1 measurement.
#
# ⛔⛔ WHY A FOURTH ARM: THE THIRD ONE NEVER SCANNED HISTORY'S FILE CONTENT AT
# ALL, AND A RULING WAS TAKEN ON ITS NUMBER.
#
# `--range <root>..HEAD` was cited in this repository's CLAUDE.md, in its
# QUEUE, on the fleet bus and in a Captain's ruling as "the history reads 7".
# It is not a history reading. `added_lines()` runs `git diff A..B`, and a
# TWO-DOT DIFF IS A NET DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TWO TREES, not the union of what
# the commits between them added. Two things are therefore invisible to it:
#
#   (a) ANYTHING ADDED AND LATER REMOVED INSIDE THE RANGE. The repair erases
#       the evidence of the debt from the very arm that is supposed to record
#       it. Measured here: the seven findings read at one commit read ZERO at
#       its child, because that child repaired the tree. The debt did not go
#       anywhere -- every blob is still in the history a clone receives.
#
#   (b) ANYTHING IN THE RANGE'S FIRST COMMIT THAT WAS NEVER TOUCHED AGAIN.
#       A file byte-identical at both endpoints contributes no `+` line, so
#       for `<root>..HEAD` THE ENTIRE ROOT COMMIT IS OUT OF SCOPE. Measured
#       here: the root commit's own CLAUDE.md cited a private brief BY FULL
#       PATH and sat there for 188 commits; it appears in no reading of the
#       seven, because it could not.
#
# ⇒ 🔑 THE FILE ARM OF `--range <root>..HEAD` IS A TREE SCAN WEARING A HISTORY
#   SCAN'S NAME, and it is strictly WEAKER than `--tree`: everything it can
#   see at HEAD, `--tree` also sees, and `--tree` additionally sees the files
#   it drops. The number it produced was the TREE RESIDUE of a commit that had
#   not yet been repaired.
#
# ⚠️ WHAT IS **NOT** WRONG, STATED SO THIS DOES NOT READ AS A WIDER INDICTMENT
#   THAN IT IS. The CI delta arm is SOUND for its job: it scans
#   `<before>..HEAD` for one push, where the net difference and "what this push
#   adds" coincide to within the push's own reverts, and the tree arm covers
#   whatever it drops. The message arm has never had this defect at all --
#   `git log` IS per-commit. The defect is confined to the AUDIT form, the one
#   spanning a long history, which is exactly the form whose number was quoted.
#
# SO: A RATCHET OVER WHAT EACH COMMIT **INTRODUCED**, diffed against its own
# parent, which is the only scan that can answer "what does a clone receive".
# It is keyed on (sha, file, line-sha16). ⛔ A TREE REPAIR NEVER SHRINKS IT:
# that is the entire point -- the tree ratchet records what the tree keeps, and
# this records what history keeps regardless of what the tree now says. It
# shrinks only under a history rewrite, which is a council act.
#
# ✅ DRIVEN, NOT ASSERTED: 11 break-probes, 10 RED, each with the unmutated
# control re-run after it (the pristine copy taken ONCE, before any probe --
# a probe that dies between mutate and restore poisons every later arm).
# Two of the reds are the DIFFERENTIAL arms: they fail if the two-dot form
# ever stops being blind, so they document the defect as much as the fix.
# ⛔ THE ELEVENTH IS DECLARED, NOT CLAIMED: removing the shallow-clone guard
# below leaves the self-test GREEN, because that guard lives in `main()` and a
# self-test in a normal repository cannot reach it. It is the same unarmed
# guard the `--range` arm has carried since the port. NAMED HERE rather than
# left to be discovered, and not quietly widened into a claim of coverage.
#
# ⚠️ NOT WIRED INTO CI YET, AND THE REASON IS A RULING, NOT AN OVERSIGHT. This
# arm has NO BASELINE, so it correctly refuses; writing that baseline is the
# accepted-debt act PUB-1 asks for, and PUB-1's scope is with the Captain (the
# set he ruled on has seven members, this arm measures eight). The wiring and
# the baseline land in ONE act when he rules -- wiring it first would red every
# build, and baselining it first would answer a scope question that is his.
