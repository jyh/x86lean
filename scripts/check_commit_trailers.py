"""The history scrub was a one-time act. Nothing has watched it since.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
On 2026-07-22 this repository's public history was rewritten to strip a
per-commit trailer that embedded a private chat-session URL. That was a
deliberate, expensive, irreversible act: every SHA before it died, and commits
from that era must now be cited by subject line because their hashes no longer
resolve.

The rule that followed it lives in prose, in a project instruction file. Prose
is read by people who read that file, and this repository has spent a fortnight
cataloguing what happens to a rule that no machine enforces. This is that
pattern's sharpest instance yet, because the cost of a lapse is not a red test:
**it is a second history rewrite, or a permanent leak.** A commit message cannot
be edited after it is pushed and fetched without breaking every clone.

Measured at the time this gate was written: `origin/main` carried **zero**
occurrences across 3067 commits — the scrub held. And **five unmerged commits on
a live feature branch each carried one**, queued to merge. The rule had already
lapsed; only the merge had not happened yet. A guard that arrives the week the
first violation appears is a guard that arrived late, which is the argument for
writing it now rather than after the next scrub.

WHAT IT CHECKS
--------------
Every commit message reachable from HEAD (or a supplied range) against a small
set of forbidden patterns. Not file contents — a URL in a source comment is a
different question with a different answer, and conflating them would make this
gate mean two things.

FAILING CLOSED
--------------
A scan that resolves to zero commits REDS rather than reporting success. An
empty scan and a clean scan produce the same green otherwise, and this
repository has shipped that exact fault twice in one fortnight: a corpus
generator that wrote nothing and reported success, and a resolver that answered
`{}` for a kind it did not recognise. The rule adopted from that, and applied
here in this order: **a gate must be shown to fail on an empty input set before
it is allowed to pass on a full one** (`--self-test` proves both).

WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO
----------------------------------
* It does not scan working-tree files. A chat URL pasted into a doc is a
  content question; this is a HISTORY question, and history is the one that
  cannot be fixed with an ordinary commit.
* It cannot see a commit that has not been written yet, which is the whole
  reason it belongs in CI on every push rather than in a local hook only.
* It says nothing about `Co-Authored-By`, which is CORRECT and stays. The scrub
  removed session URLs; it deliberately kept authorship attribution, and a gate
  that swept both would quietly undo a decision it was never asked about.
