# prove_pre_push.sh -- RED PROVEN BEFORE GREEN IS BELIEVED, for .githooks/pre-push.
#
# A guard that has only ever been seen to pass is indistinguishable from a guard
# that cannot fail. This prover drives BOTH arms of .githooks/pre-push against a
# real `git push` into a real (scratch, bare) remote:
#
#   GREEN arms  -- a clean push must SUCCEED **and print its receipt**. A silent
#                  success is not evidence: a hook that never ran passes too.
#   RED arms    -- a private-record path in a commit MESSAGE, the same path in a
#                  FILE the commit ADDS, each of the FIVE trailer shapes in a
#                  message, and a path and a URL each ADDED THEN REMOVED inside
#                  one push must each be REFUSED, and the remote ref must NOT
#                  have moved. The add-then-remove arms first show the net-diff
#                  gate alone passing, so they test the population they name.
#                  A lane name in a SUBJECT only, a family reference in a
#                  SUBJECT only, and a lane name in a BODY only are each REFUSED
#                  too (desk QA), each after a control shows the two older arms
#                  passing that range.
#   FAIL CLOSED -- with the scanner missing, a clean push is refused; so it is
#                  with the subject gate missing.
#   DELETE arm  -- deleting a ref pushes no objects and must be ALLOWED.
#   MUTATION    -- the same refused push must SUCCEED with `--no-verify`. Without
#     CONTROL      this arm, every red above is equally consistent with "the push
#                  would have failed anyway", and the prover would prove nothing.
#
# ⛔ THE FIXTURES ARE NOT RETYPED. The forbidden shapes are read OUT OF THE GATE
#    SCRIPTS THEMSELVES (check_private_paths._EMPLOYER and
#    check_commit_trailers._SESSION_KEY), assembled at run time. Two reasons, and
#    the second is not style: a retyped fixture drifts silently when the gate's
#    list changes, AND this prover is a TRACKED FILE that the gate's own tree
#    ratchet scans -- spelling a private path here would make the prover trip the
#    gate it exists to drive.
#
# ⛔ THE SANDBOX IS REACHED BY ABSOLUTE PATH AND `git -C`, NEVER BY `cd`. A
#    fixture that reaches its sandbox by changing directory can, on any early
#    failure, run its git commands against THE REPOSITORY UNDER TEST.
