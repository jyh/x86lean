# Tests.Coverage — the coverage table cannot drift from the model

Plan v1 §3.2: coverage is "a generated table, never prose".  A generated table
can still LIE, in two directions, and both are checked here:

* a row for a form the model no longer has (the table over-claims);
* a form the model has with no row (the table under-reports, which sounds
  harmless and is not — it means the tier and the decode-trust columns are
  silent about a form somebody may be relying on).

The usual coverage-claim failure is the first, and the usual test only catches
the second.  Both directions are `decide`d below.

A THIRD check, which is the one that would actually have caught a real drift:
every mnemonic in the table must appear in the DIFFERENTIAL VECTOR TABLE.  A row
claiming `T-exact` for a form that no vector ever executes is a claim backed by
nothing.

LANE. Personal lane, public sources only.
